I am beginning to believe that the evolution of psychology as a study could potentially be described as “Wait, I can’t believe we thought that was correct. Clearly, this is correct. But I do not fully know why.” When early psychologists theorized explanations of our human condition and behavior, they had no idea the level of complexity functions in our brain take to achieve everyday survival. Ebbinghaus may have found a relationship between accuracy in memory recollection and time, but I do not believe he considered that memory could be strengthened or weakened in context specific settings. I think that psychology has matured immensely in the past 50-100 years and will continue for many years more. When specifically looking at the field of Cognitive Psychology and its related broader field of Cognitive Science, I believe we are in the process of viewing the human brain as an organic, highly malleable, computer. 
I was delighted to confirm many of my hunches about this belief upon reading Miller’s Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two [@miller_magical_1956],  Newell’s ‘You can’t play 20 questions with nature and win’ [@newell_you_1973], and Schacter’s analysis of Richard Semon’s Theory of Memory [@schacter_richard_1978]. I could not help but notice that each of these papers deal with a certain level of ‘enlightenment’ regarding a status quo view in psychology. 


Miller, almost comically, feels haunted by recurring trends in data showing a consistent range of information stimuli being between five and nine, often in the sweet spot of the ‘magical’ number seven. It seems random at first, but Miller even discusses the usefulness of the number seven, such as its ubiquity in scales for measurement. Additionally, he discusses how the use of ‘Recoding’ is apparent in many humans and can account for 'chunking' larger bits of information into a more comprehensive range, fitting with the magical number range. I cannot help but draw a comparison with this idea to compressing information like that of a .zip file on a computer. The idea that we simplify and chunk information, whether it be syllables in language or flavors of ice cream, into smaller bits to better preserve memory, seems incredibly intuitive within the context of a species prioritizing survival. 


Recoding makes too much sense as method of survival for a primitive ape like we were not too long ago. We are able to absorb so much sensory information that to have it all on hand to use when needed would overload our ability to focus on a specific goal, likely relating to our survival. Therefore, compressing information to be accessed in further detail when needed would be an advantageous trait to enable greater survival chances. Of course, today we are not as concerned with daily life-and-death situations, but our brains have not changed significantly enough to completely alter these functions. I understand that this paper is from 1956 when discussion on evolution was not as publicly widespread, but I would have loved to see Miller’s comments on our limitations to information we receive, process, and remember linked to the idea that we would have developed limitations for our own benefit in nature. 


Newell, while similarly giving his explicit stresses over observations in psychological research, focuses on how our collective approach is too focused on low and mid-level framework, rather than larger, system-based understandings. He explains that the process of iterating through a series of yes or no questions (the game of 20 questions) ignores building a larger web of understanding in order to answer the ‘big picture’ questions of Psychology.  Specifically, he says the field odes not model ‘control structure,’ which could be compared to a programming language. Rather than understanding how we are wholly coded, finding a simple but internally valid result such as “Rats choose food over pain” is the de facto scientific goal. This method of slow iterations finding binary answers might be too stringent to the scientific method. 


Newell mentions the game of chess as a real life situation in which several measures of planning, analysis, evaluation, etc. are made in the process of playing, so to study a single variable focused on one of the decisions made ignores the full context of understanding our brain’s function in playing chess. How does this relate to understanding our brain as a computer? A computer system is not just one function, line after line. If we only study the central processing unit (cpu) of a computer, we might forget that a cpu intensive operation requires more energy from the power supply, so if there is an issue with the power supply, the cpu’s behavior may alter appropriately. The cpu may alter its priorities and functions in relation to other components of the system. If we only focus on the operations of one component of a system at a time, we miss out on the multi-operational processes humans constantly employ in any real-life situation.


Lastly, Shacter et al. detail Richard Semon’s Theory of Memory, largely ignored at the time of Semon’s life. Semon was significantly ahead of his time in proposing that memory acquisition and retrieval be treated conditionally. Semon proposed a much more nuanced view on memory than the simplified sense of the stimuli as an input and recollection of/response to the stimuli as an output. Under conditions, the translation of perception to memory may be prone to distortion, explaining inaccurate memories. Similar to Newell’s focus on system level operations, Semon emphasized the “unity and wholistic nature of ‘sensation-complexes.’” [@schacter_richard_1978] 


We know today that studying terms and their definitions with flash cards is a more effective method of memorization than simply staring at a list of terms and their definitions. However, it is still a fairly shallow method of learning about a topic without internalizing the information. Semon would argue that our memory does not just work as a simple associative link between X and Y, but that the link between X and Y can fit in with the web of overall related information. Similarly, I heard many times to study information for a test in a similar setting to how I would take the test to better ‘mentally prepare me.’ Professors have told me to sit in the same seat for lectures and exams. One professor even said that if I came to lecture while inebriated, I should come to the final drunk too. This again fits in with Semon’s ‘horizontal association,’ in which stimuli shared at the same time work together to solidify a stronger memory. Semon saw the brain as a much more contextually adjustable and therefore malleable system. 


Interestingly, Semon proposed laws that coincide with ideas that Newell and Miller proposed focusing on for further research. The Law of Engraphy suggests focusing on system-wide use of information and operations within the mind, much like Newell’s advocation for system-level scope in research. The law of Ecphory suggests that a memory can be partially available for recall, so that when it is recalled the memory can be further retrieved, much like Miller’s advocation for chunking and recoding. It’s a stretch, but maybe if Semon received more attention at the time, Newell and Miller would not have been so stressed and worried?


These three papers give light to both how far we have come in psychology and how much more research need to complete. The relatively recent push to view the mind as computational yet dynamic system of processes convinces me to call the brain an organic, highly malleable computer. Moving forward, I am very interested in seeing how comparative cognition/psychology pushes our perspectives on how different species develop different behaviors as a means of advantageous survival characteristics. I believe our brains work as they do because millions of years of evolution iterated our mental functions to operate more efficiently, just as we do in a much smaller scope of time with designing better computers.
